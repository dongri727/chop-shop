# Introduction

This project was initiated by the planners who were deeply impressed by "The History of Everything," Flutter's earliest application, and started this project to read and study its code. Anyone who shares the same interest is welcome to join, whether it's adding a single line of code or writing a few words of opinion. Full-fledged participation is also welcome.

Although "The History of Everything" is a beautiful application of animation, the target of this project is the creation of a chronological timeline that represents the passage of time in a very smooth motion. From the beginning of the universe (BIG BANG) to "now," from a general overview that allows you to get the time distance right to zooming in and seeing the details, it is intriguing to see what features of Flutter this consists of. Words cannot do it justice, so please take a look at the actual application.

## Project Goals

We have three steps in mind for this project:

Carefully study the code in which this smooth movement is established without using any particular package.
Rewrite the code as it was written in Flutter1 to support Flutter3 for further understanding.
Aim to package this wonderful feature so that many people can take advantage of it.

## Package Functions

We are considering the following three functions for the package:

An extendable and retractable time axis
Display of scale characters linked to the time axis
Display of items linked to the time axis

## issues

We will write about specific issues in the issue as they arise, so please choose the ones that interest you. We look forward to your participation.
